 ## Slide 1 (What is Agile)

Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project. Instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.

## Slide 2 (The Agile manifesto)

The Agile manifesto is a formal proclamation of 4 key values and 12 principles to guide an iterative and people-centric approach to software development. The values are:
1.	Individuals and interactions are more important than processes and tools.
2.	Working software is more important than comprehensive documentation.
3.	Customer collaboration is more important than contract negotiation
4.	Responding to change is more important than following a plan 

## Slide 3 (Agile vs waterfall)

Agile has some differences from traditional software development methodologies. Consider these differences on the example of a waterfall.

When it comes to making changes in the product or a process, agile methodology is much flexible than the waterfall methodology. In the traditional approach, every single process is clearly defined and planned from beginning of the project.

In Agile methodology, the clients and decision makes are actively involved from the initiation, planning, review, and in the testing part a product. In the traditional approach, the project manager is holding reins of the project, other don’t get to make the major decisions.

Owing to its linear approach, the traditional project management methodology is majorly used for small or less complex project.

Agile could be your best bet in terms of managing big and complex project.

## Slide 4 (Agile framework)

There are many different types of Agile methodologies that you can choose from when organizing your project. Here are the most common methodologies or Agile frameworks that you can choose from:
1.	Scrum
2.	Kanban
3.	Extreme Programming (XP)
4.	Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
5.	Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
6.	Crystal
7.	Lean

## Slide 5 (What is Scrum)

One of the most popular frameworks of Agile is Scrum.
It is a framework, within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.


## Slide 6 (What is Scrum)

Scrum is: 
* Lightweight
* Simple to understand 
* Difficult to master

## Slide 7 (The structure of Scrum)

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage.

## Slide 8 (The Scrum Team)

The Scrum Team consists of
1. Product Owner, 
2. Development Team, 
3. Scrum Master.

A Product Owner (PO) represents the voice of a customer. This person is empowered to make global decisions about the product, maintain a product backlog, define and prioritize all backlog items. He/she also communicates the product vision to the team.

Development teams have the following characteristics:
* They are self-organizing;
* Development teams are cross-functional;
* Scrum recognizes no titles for development team members;
* Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the development team;
* Individual development team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the development team as a whole.

The ideal size for a development is between 3 and 9 people, not including the scrum master and product owner.

A Scrum Master keeps the whole process. This is a key person who facilitates team communication, removes potential obstacles, arrange all discussions. The main responsibility of this person is to always care about the team and product functionality.

## Slide 9 (Scrum values)

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values. The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems. Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.

## Slide 10 (The key Scrum artifacts) 

The key Scrum methodology artifacts: 
1.	Product backlog is a complete set of the functionality
2.	Sprint backlog is a prioritized list of tasks the team needs to complete within a Sprint
3.	Sprint goal shows the desired outcome of an iteration that provides a shared goal to the team, which goal has to be defined before the team starts the Sprint in order to focus to get this goal.
4.	Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.

## Slide 11 (The Scrum ceremonies)

The Scrum methodology is closely related to special ceremonies and meetings. Sprint planning meetings, daily standups, the Sprint review, and the retrospective are the required Scrum events.

## Slide 12 (The Scrum cycle) 

Let’s see how scrum works on the example one cycle.
1.	Product owner maintain a product backlog, define and prioritize all backlog items
2.	At the sprint planning, product owner presents the features to be completed in the sprint. The entire scrum team creates the plan which to be performed in the sprint.
3.	The team starts Sprint. Usually the sprint continues 1-4 weeks. Every day of the sprint, the team holds the daily scrum. Where the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours and tracks the progress of tasks.
Some Development Teams will use questions, some will be more discussion based.
1 What did I do yesterday? 
2 What will I do today?
3 Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
4.	A Sprint Review holds at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value.
5.	The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint

And the next this process repeat.


## Slide 13 (Advantages of Scrum)

Advantages of Scrum
* Scrum has more transparency and visibility than any other methodology.
* It increases the team accountability.
* Scrum is easy with changes
* Scrum is a cost saving development methodology

## Slide 14 (Disadvantages of Scrum)

Disadvantages of Scrum
* Scrum need to be experienced and high-level persons
* Scrum team requires experience and devoted team.
* Less experienced scrum master can ruin the whole process of development.
* If the task is defined poorly then the project can be lead to inaccuracies.

## Slide 15 (Using scrum)

Scrum’s roots are in software, but it is being used in many more domains ranging from developing cars, pharmaceutical drugs, even running the police force. Also scrum is popular in marketing and education.

Scrum is an approach that helps teams to form around solving complex problems.
